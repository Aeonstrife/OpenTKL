Use as a base for your own designs, renders or order as is (read important info at the bottom).

Details:
 - F13 TKL layout supporting ANSI, ISO, stepped and normal CAPS, Split right shift, and split backspace.
 - Custom plate with tons of flext and acoustic cuts using TGR Jane V2-ish mount points.
 - 3 optional internal weight pieces can be filled with foam for dampening or metal for more heft.
 - 7 degree typing angle.
 - Flush USB-C connector built into the PCB, no need for a daughterboard (though the PCB supports it).


Important Info (READ BEFORE ORDERING):
 - I do not offer any sort of warranty for this, nor can I be held liable if something goes wrong.
 - Renders do not represent the final profuct (seam is not visible etc.).
 - Please, PLEASE look over the design before you do anything with it, it's possible and very likely that there are some errors, I'm just a human.
