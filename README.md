![Alt text](Renders/OpenTKLv2_double.png?raw=true)

VERY MUCH WIP!!!

Use as a base for your own designs, renders or order as is (read important info at the bottom).

Details:
 - F13 TKL layout supporting ANSI, ISO, stepped and normal CAPS, Split right shift, and split backspace.
 - Custom plate with tons of flex and acoustic cuts using TGR Jane V2ce-ish mount points.
 - Back weight with a small engraving in the corner

 - 6.9 degree typing angle.
 - Internal silicone dampener pad under the alphas for acoustics
 - Internal ridges in the case for acoustics and pcb support so the switches don't short into the case on more flexible plastic plates

 - Flush USB-C connector built into the PCB, no need for a daughterboard (though the PCB supports it).
 - Skuf feet.
 - M3 screws for everything except the plate which still uses m2.5


Important Info (READ BEFORE ORDERING):
 - I do not offer any sort of warranty for this, nor can I be held liable if something goes wrong.
 - Renders do not represent the final profuct (seam is not visible etc.).
 - Please, PLEASE look over the design before you do anything with it, it's possible and very likely that there are some errors, I'm just a human.

If you use this as a template for your own design, please give credit(same goes for renders).
